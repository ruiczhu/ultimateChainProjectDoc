# Project Overview

#### 1. Project Overview
- **1.1 Project Background**
    - Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers, ensuring security and transparency. DeFi (Decentralized Finance) leverages blockchain to offer financial services without intermediaries.
    - This project aims to create a Smart Contract Based Lottery Platform, enhancing transparency, reducing costs, and increasing user trust by automating the lottery process and ensuring fairness through secure cryptographic methods.

- **1.2 Project Objectives**
  - Develop a transparent, secure, and fair lottery platform using blockchain technology and smart contracts.
  - Ensure all transactions and lottery results are recorded on the blockchain for complete transparency.
  - Automate the entire lottery process, from ticket purchase to prize distribution, using smart contracts.
  - Implement secure cryptographic methods for random number generation to ensure unbiased lottery results.
