#### 5. Advanced Features
- **Automated Vulnerability Checking**
    - We integrated automated vulnerability checking tools such as Slither into our project.
    - **Slither**: A static analysis framework for Solidity that detects vulnerabilities, optimizes code, and enforces best practices.
    - **Findings**:
        - **Reentrancy**: Identified and mitigated reentrancy vulnerabilities in the `buyTicket` and `withdrawFunds` functions.
        - **Unchecked Call Return Values**: Ensured all external calls check return values to prevent unexpected behavior.
        - **Gas Limit Issues**: Optimized functions to avoid exceeding the block gas limit.
    - **Solutions**:
        - Added checks for call return values in all external calls.
        - Refactored and optimized code to reduce gas consumption.
